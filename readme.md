# CSIR NET Physical Sciences
This repository is a sorted, organized, and as well-maintained as possible collection of previous year questions that have come in the CSIR NET Physical Sciences exam over the years. The hope is to provide a one-stop shop for aspiring physicists, professors, researchers, and lecturers to practice questions from topics they prefer instead of having to navigate across each year's papers.

## Structure
The repository contains multiple folders, one for each subject. Questions from different years are typed and developed via `LaTeX` and the year they appeared is also listed. Further, questions from Section B and Section C are placed under separate headings. Section A, which contains of general aptitude, has its own folder.

Note that since I am just typing up the questions as I go along, some of those might be repeated across the years.

## Solutions
Where possible, I have tried to list the answer. If you can find the time to provide solutions to different questions, start a pull request and it will be much appreciated.

## Analysis of Question Papers
While a detailed analysis of each question paper will take far too **much** time and effort for me to perform at right now, I am hoping to automate the analysis of the number of questions that have appeared in each subject.

## Contribute
If you have some time, I would appreciate your help with adding questions to this repository as we go along.
